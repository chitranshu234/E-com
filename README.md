## ## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* npm or yarn package manager

### ### Backend Setup

**Important:** This is a frontend-only application. It requires a backend server to be running separately to function correctly. The application is configured to make API calls to **`http://localhost:8080/api`**.

Ensure your backend service is running on that port before starting the frontend.

### ### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chitranshu234/E-com.git](https://github.com/chitranshu234/E-com.git)
    cd E-com
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will now be running on a local port, typically `http://localhost:5173`.

## ## Configuration

The base URL for the backend API is configured in a single location. If your backend is running on a different port or domain, you can easily change it here:

* **File:** `src/api/productService.js`
* **Variable:** `API_BASE_URL`
