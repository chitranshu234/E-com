Logical Component Breakdown
Contexts: ThemeProvider, CartProvider, WishlistProvider, etc., for global state management.

Components: Reusable UI elements like Header, Footer, ProductCard, ThemeToggle, FiltersPanel, and QuickViewModal.

Pages: Top-level components for each route, such as HomePage, ProductsPage, ProductDetailPage, and CartPage.
