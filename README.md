# ShopSphere: Full-Stack E-Commerce Application üõçÔ∏è

Welcome to **ShopSphere**, a complete full-stack e-commerce application featuring a dynamic **React frontend** and a robust **Spring Boot backend**. This project is designed to showcase a modern, feature-rich shopping experience from client to server.



---

## ## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ShopSphere uses a classic client-server architecture, organized within a single monorepo:

* **Frontend (Client):** A responsive single-page application (SPA) built with **React** that provides a rich user interface.
* **Backend (Server):** A powerful RESTful API built with **Spring Boot** that handles business logic and data persistence using an **H2 in-memory database**.

## ## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the entire application running locally, follow these steps.

### ### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
* **Apache Maven**
* **Node.js and npm**

### ### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chitranshu234/E-com.git](https://github.com/chitranshu234/E-com.git)
    cd E-com
    ```

2.  **Run the Backend (Spring Boot):**
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Build the project using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
