# ShopSphere: Full-Stack E-Commerce Application üõçÔ∏è

Welcome to **ShopSphere**, a complete full-stack e-commerce application featuring a dynamic **React frontend** and a robust **Spring Boot backend**. This project is designed to showcase a modern, feature-rich shopping experience from client to server.



---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ShopSphere uses a classic client-server architecture:

* **Frontend (Client):** A responsive single-page application (SPA) built with **React** that provides a rich user interface. It runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
* **Backend (Server):** A powerful RESTful API built with **Spring Boot** that handles business logic, data persistence, and serves data to the frontend. It runs on `http://localhost:8080`.
